### About the organizers and sponsors
**Louvain-li-Nux**: This Game Jam is organized by the Louvain-li-Nux, a kot-à-projet that aims to defend and promote the values of free software through the student and academic community of Louvain-la-Neuve. To do this, we organize many activities allowing participants to meet and exchange around computing, while discovering a plethora of open-sourced and, often, free tools.

## Structure of the Game Jam
* You will form groups of 3 to 4 people.
* The theme of the Game Jam will be randomly selected at 2.30PM on the first day. 
* The Louvain-li-Nux's team is there to help you if you have any question about the Game Jam. Be aware that some of them are not proficient in ``python``. For questions about python's syntax, libraries or APIs, please use https://stackoverflow.com/ or the Official Game Jam 2.0 Discord at https://discord.gg/CthqEKs (do not hesitate to post dank memes on it)

## Game's specifications
* The game must be written in Python 3.6.7 or newer
* The game must be completely open-source. No proprietary libraries or APIs will be allowed. 
* The game can be single player or multiplayer but keep in mind that setting up a LAN network during the Game Jam can take a lot of time. Two players on the same keyboard is a good trade-off. 
* All kind of input/output can be used but we do not provide controllers.
* There is no need to code a menu to your game.
* The game has to be original and must therefore not be a copy of another game. 

## Tips, tricks and resources
### Guidelines through a creative project
* Brainstorming is the key ! Gather as many ideas as you can. 
* Make a list of criteria for your game.
* Select the 3 best ideas corresponding to your criteria.
* Write the specifications for your 3 ideas.
* Select the coolest one and present it to a member of the Louvain-li-Nux, he will give you some feedback.
* If you encounter some problems during the conception of your game, you can still go back to a previous idea.
